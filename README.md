🔬 Artemia App

Project Overview

Artemia is a mobile application developed to raise awareness and eventually implement detection capabilities for microplastics in food sources. The app's name pays homage to Artemia franciscana, the model organism used in the project creator's Master's thesis to study the genomic impact of microplastic pollution.

Currently, the application focuses on image management and providing essential educational resources. The core function of automated microplastic analysis is scheduled for future implementation.

✨ Current Features

📷 Image Capture & Selection: Users can launch the device camera to take new photos or select existing images from their photo library.

📚 Learn Module: A dedicated educational section providing crucial information on microplastics, their origins, environmental impact, and genomic effects, informed by experimental research.

Clean iOS UI: Built using SwiftUI for a modern, highly responsive, and native iOS user experience.

🛣️ Future Roadmap

The primary development focus is integrating a robust Microplastic Detection Engine (AI/ML) that will:

Analyze user-provided images (taken or selected).

Provide a confidence score regarding the potential presence of microplastic particles within the sample.
